The .py files run in Blender's scripting environment. Adjust the path to in the script and run it. You can select an existing model/armature before you run the .tma script.

The .bt files are 010 editor templates. There's some stuff that isn't figured out, for example, the very end of building .tmm files.

The major thing that isn't figured out is the normal/tangent/bitangents for the .tmm.data file. It's clearly the 6 bytes, but no idea how they are decoded.
